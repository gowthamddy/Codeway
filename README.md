**Codeway Machine Learning Virtual Internship
**
TASK-1:Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
       movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
       can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
       such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
       Machines.

TASK-2:Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
       dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
       experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
       or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

TASK-3:Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based
       service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like
       usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like
       Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict
       churn.

TASK-4:Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
       legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
       classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic
